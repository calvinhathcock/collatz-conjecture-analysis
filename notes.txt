collatz conjecture notes

AKA Ulam, Thwaites, kakutani, hasse's, syracuse problem, 3n+1

A sequence that always ends up at 0. 

If odd
3x+1

If even 
x/2

"hailstone numbers" - go up and down but eventually hit the ground

"stopping time" - iterations do get to 1


What will my program do?
- Console application that can run a simulation of the collatz conjecture with any starting number
- stores each iteration in database
- log different attributes for each number 
	- stopping time 
	- each number visited
	- number of evens vs odds
	- 
- generate dashboard with various charts and graphs 
	- Dash by plotly?
- dynamically updated as more passes are done or one alrge pass to begin with 
- maybe one large pass and then have commands for grabbing certain data sets and what not - API 

Next steps
- create repo 
- Set-up ORM
- Play with some queries
- Export data
- Generate visuals 

End goal 
-  a website used to analyze data of the collatz conjecture and simplifies complex queries as well as providing
dynamic visuals
